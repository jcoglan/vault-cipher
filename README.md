# vault-cipher

Provides a high-level authenticated encryption API that
[Vault](http://github.com/jcoglan/vault) uses to encrypt its stored settings.
It is not intended to be a long-term solution since eventually we will be able
to use GCM mode or NaCl in Node, but for now I'm using a hand-rolled
encrypt-then-MAC scheme based on AES-256-CBC and HMAC-SHA-256.

It is very high-level, providing a simple way to encrypt and decrypt text:

```js
var Cipher = require('vault-cipher'),
    cipher = new Cipher('your secret key');

cipher.encrypt('some text', function(error, ciphertext) {

  cipher.decrypt(ciphertext, function(error, message) {

    // message == 'some text'
  });
});
```


### Settings

The cipher is configurable by passing options to the constructor, for example:

```js
var cipher = new Cipher('secret key', {format: 'hex', work: 1000})
```

The available options are:

* `format`: the output format of the ciphertext, either `base64` (default) or
  `hex`
* `salt`: a salt string used during PBKDF2 key derivation, defaults to a GUID
  embedded in the library
* `work`: the number of PBKDF2 iterations used to derive the encryption and
  signing keys, default is `1000`
